# epi

This is the base package for epidemic forecasting in [SyncroSim](www.syncrosim.com). This package in combination with it’s add-on packages provides a software framework for providing real-time forecasts of epidemic infections and deaths that can be rapidly deployed for use anywhere in the world. The framework allows users to generate daily forecasts for jurisdictions ranging in size from public health units to countries, based on real-time gathering of online epidemic data and access to the world’s best forecasting models. Built upon our well-established SyncroSim software platform, our framework allows end users to generate epidemic forecasts that are specific to their jurisdiction and questions, by mixing-and-matching datasets and models from around the world with their own local data and models. Both the data and models within the system can be updated in near real-time, allowing scientists to continually adapt and improve their forecasts as an epidemic evolves over time; furthermore, all of the forecasts generated by the system include robust assessments of uncertainty.  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, our framework allows policy makers to game with their own local “what-if” scenarios regarding possible future changes to public health measures, forecasting the resulting consequences in advance of on-the-ground changes. 

**Solution Architecture**

At the core of our solution is our desktop SyncroSim software. Data and models provided by others online can be automatically downloaded on a regular schedule, while local data and models can also be added privately. Decision makers can then use these data and models to generate forecasts under alternative “what-if” future scenarios, and select a subset of these results to display both internally and online. All model inputs and outputs are stored in a common structure, allowing for direct comparison across datasets and models.

**Packages**: Add-on packages for the *epi* base package are created by model developers and data providers to do various specific tasks, such as downloading data and running models. Each package provides SyncroSim with two things: (1) an XML configuration file specifying the format of all the inputs and outputs required for a particular set of tasks, and (2) the actual code to be run in order to complete the tasks. For the pandemic forecasting system, a base *epi* package was first developed to standardize the structure and format of all epidemiological data. Add-on packages were then developed to do specific tasks, such as download data from various sources, transform data, and run alternative forecasting models.
